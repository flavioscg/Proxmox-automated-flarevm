# Proxmox automated Windows setup for FlareVM

## Overview
This script automates the process of creating a Windows virtual machine on Proxmox, complete with custom configurations and driver installations, making it ready for [FlareVM](https://github.com/mandiant/flare-vm). The script mounts a Windows ISO, customizes it with `autounattend.xml` for a smooth installation, and sets up necessary VirtIO drivers for optimal performance in a Proxmox environment. Following VM creation, you’ll be able to complete the FlareVM installation with the provided PowerShell script.

## Requirements
- **Git** installed on your Proxmox node
- **Internet connection** – Internet access is necessary for script downloads during the FlareVM setup, and it is a fundamental requirement for FlareVM’s installation process.
- **Windows 10 Official ISO** in the same directory as the other repository files https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10iso
- **Patience & Coffee** ☕️ – This process will take some time!

### Steps
1. **Clone the repository** to get all necessary files.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/flavioscg/Proxmox-automated-flarevm.git
    cd Proxmox-automated-flarevm
    ```

2. **Run the script and answer the prompts**:
    ```bash
    ./start.sh
    ```
    > The script will ask for the ISO name, VM ID, RAM, cores, and disk size. **Note**: At least 60 GB is required to meet FlareVM's needs.

3. **Go to the created and started VM, you should be presented with the disk selection screen**. You won't see any disk because you need to load the VirtIO drivers first. Click **Load**, then **OK**, and select the VirtIO drivers.

   If you don't see any drivers, try clicking **Rescan**.

4. **Choose the available disk** created in the initial configuration and start the Windows installation.

5. **Continue with the installation** and wait for the process to complete. Once done, you will find the `install-flarevm.ps1` script on the desktop.

6. **Run the post-installation**
   - Open PowerShell as Administrator

   - Move to the Desktop directory
     ```powershell
     cd Desktop
     ```
   - Run the pre-FlareVM script:
     ```powershell
     .\pre-flarevm.ps1
     ```

   The script will disable **Antimalware** and **Windows Update**, and then launch the FlareVM installation. Follow the on-screen instructions.

7. **Final Snapshot**: Create a snapshot of the VM for future restores. ⚠️
